# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
# Run the app locally (from the app/ directory)
cd app && uvicorn main:app --port 8000

# Unit tests (no server needed — they import the adapter and stub its API objects)
pytest tests/test_36_portaswitch_call_queues.py
pytest tests -q -p no:warnings

# Integration tests against a running adapter
pytest --server http://<host:port> --user <user> --password <pw> tests

# Formatting
black --line-length 119 <path>
```

`pytest` needs the app dependencies importable (`app/requirements.txt` plus
`tests/requirements.txt`); the unit tests add `app/` to `sys.path` themselves. `models.py`
imports pydantic and every adapter module is pulled in through `bss.adapters`, so even a
pure-unit test run needs `fastapi`, `pydantic*`, `httpx`, `google-cloud-firestore`,
`google-cloud-pubsub` and `python-jose` present. `asyncio_mode = "strict"` — async tests
carry an explicit `@pytest.mark.asyncio`.

## This is the live adapter repository

`origin` is PortaOne Gerrit (`git.portaone.com:29418/porta-phone/adapter_python`), so
commits follow the corporate review process, not Conventional Commits — invoke the
**`gerrit-review`** skill before committing or sending anything to review.

`~/webtrit/multi-tenant-demo/adapter/webtrit_bss_adapter/` is an **older copy of this
same code** that has drifted (different `adapter.py`, `models.py`, `serializer.py`, and it
lacks `app/metrics.py`). Never read it for current behaviour and never edit it — this
repository is the one that ships.

## Architecture

A FastAPI app that translates WebTrit **Core**'s adapter API into whatever a specific
PBX/BSS speaks. Core is the only client; end-user apps never talk here directly.

- **`app/main.py`** — every route. Each handler validates the bearer token
  (`bss.validate_session`), gates the feature with `is_method_allowed(Capabilities.x)`,
  then delegates to the loaded adapter through `call_bss`.
- **`app/bss/models.py`** — the wire contract as pydantic models. It mirrors Core's
  OpenAPI spec (which Core generates from its Elixir `OpenApiSpexExt` schemas — there is
  no committed spec file on either side, see `core/rel/overlays/bin/gen_openapi_spec`).
  Sections marked `# adding this manually` are hand-written extensions.
- **`app/bss/adapters/__init__.py`** — `BSSAdapter`, the abstract base every vendor
  adapter subclasses. A method left unoverridden raises `NotImplementedError`, and
  nothing catches it — `call_bss` translates only `asyncio.TimeoutError`, and there is
  no exception handler — so it reaches the client as a **`500`**. The only `501` in the
  app comes from `is_method_allowed`, i.e. from a capability that is switched off.
- **`app/bss/adapters/`** — the vendor implementations: `portaswitch/` (the real one),
  plus `netsapiens`, `freepbx`, `ext_db_3cx` and `example` as a template.
- **`app/module_loader.py`** — which adapter loads is runtime config:
  `BSS_ADAPTER_MODULE` + `BSS_ADAPTER_CLASS`.
- **`app/app_config.py`** — `AppConfig.get_conf_val("Section", "Option")` reads an
  env var built by upper-casing and `_`-joining the path, so `("Capabilities", "VOICEMAIL")`
  is `CAPABILITIES_VOICEMAIL`. **Every config option is therefore an env var whose name is
  derived, never declared** — grep for the `get_conf_val` call to find one.

### Capabilities

Two layers, and both must say yes:

- `CAPABILITIES` on the adapter class — what this adapter has *code* for.
- `CONFIG_CAPABILITIES_OPTIONS` on `BSSAdapter` — the per-deployment switch and its
  default, resolved by `calculate_capabilities()`. A capability absent from the class
  list can never be switched on. Where the result lands differs per adapter:
  `BSSAdapter.initialize()` stores it in `self.capabilities`, while `PortaSwitchAdapter`
  computes it in `__init__` into `self._cached_capabilities` and serves that.

The result is served as `supported` in `GET /system-info` and is what Core forwards to
clients so they can show or hide a control. Several entries describe features that live
**entirely in Core** and that PortaSwitch knows nothing about — `conference` and
`conversationMute` are pure advertising, there only so a client can tell a new Core from
an old one, as are `voicemailSave` and `voicemailTrash`, which have no switch and come
with `voicemail` itself. `voicemailForward` is the one Core reads: it refuses forwarding
when the entry is absent, so switching that one off changes behaviour, not just what
clients are told.

`calculate_capabilities()` copies the class list before editing it
(`capabilities = list(self.CAPABILITIES)`), and that copy is load-bearing: for the
PortaSwitch adapter the method **runs twice** — once in `__init__`, once in
`initialize()` — so editing the class attribute in place used to leave a
config-disabled capability missing from the shared list, where no later call could
switch it back on. Keep it a copy.

`example.py` overrides `calculate_capabilities` entirely and returns its class list
verbatim, so neither the config switches nor `CAPABILITY_DEPENDENCIES` apply there.
That is deliberate — the demo adapter advertises everything it codes for — but it also
means the documented template to copy does not honour either mechanism.

### PortaSwitch adapter

- **Two realms.** `api/account.py` acts as the signed-in subscriber (its access token is
  the session's); `api/admin.py` acts as the installation's admin account. Some data only
  one of them can see — the call-queue list, for instance, is admin-only, because the
  account realm returns just the caller's own membership row.
- **`async_http_api.py`** is the httpx/asyncio stack that only this adapter inherits
  (WT-1720). In-flight non-streamed requests are capped strictly below the connection-pool
  size, because a request cancelled while queued for a full pool permanently loses that
  pool slot (WT-1922). Streamed downloads hand their permit back once headers arrive.
- **`failover.py`** — disaster-recovery site switching. Detecting that the main site is
  down is reactive (timeouts), while switching *back* is authoritative
  (`operating_mode` from `generic.get_session_data`).
- **`serializer.py`** — every PortaBilling payload → wire model conversion. Field names
  and date formats live here, not in `adapter.py`.

### Voicemail is an IMAP mailbox, and that shapes the whole feature

PortaBilling exposes exactly five mailbox calls (`api/account.py`):
`get_mailbox_message_list` (filterable only by `from_date`/`to_date`),
`get_mailbox_message_details`, `get_mailbox_message_attachment` (`wav`/`mp3`/`au`),
`set_mailbox_messages_flag` and `delete_mailbox_messages`.

Consequences that are easy to get wrong:

- **There are no folders.** The list is flat. `flags` on each message is the only
  per-message state, and `set_mailbox_messages_flag` accepts only `Seen`, `Answered` and
  `Flagged` (`types.py`). `\Deleted` is not reachable.
- **`saved` is `\Flagged`.** That keeps the state in PortaSwitch, shared across the
  subscriber's devices and consistent with the UM webmail, and costs no storage anywhere.
- **`delete_mailbox_messages` is permanent** — there is no trash, and nothing to restore
  from.
- **There is no forward API**, and none of the flags can carry one.

So a **Trash** folder and **forwarding** cannot be implemented here at all: both are
Core-side features. Core keeps the per-user trash state and, for a forward, downloads the
attachment through `GET /user/voicemails/{id}/attachment` and stores that one copy itself.
This adapter's share of the feature is `saved` and the capability flags; do not add a
`folder` query parameter here, because only Core knows what is in the trash and the
partitioning has to happen where both halves of the state are.

The same mailbox is real e-mail: a flag set here is visible in the subscriber's UM
webmail and any IMAP client, which is why repurposing `Answered` to mean anything else
would corrupt what they see.

## Documentation rules

When adding a config option, a route, a capability or any user-facing behaviour:
- document the option in `README.md` (its env-var name is derived by `get_conf_val`, so it
  is invisible unless written down);
- keep the route's FastAPI `description`/`response_model` accurate — that text *is* the
  published OpenAPI spec;
- update this file when a load-bearing constraint changes;
- add it to `webtrit_deploy_internal` (Helm `values.yaml` + ConfigMap template).

This applies to every change — documentation is part of the definition of done.
